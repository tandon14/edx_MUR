Project: Movie Recommendation System

Install folder: /edx_MUR                      ( MUR ~ Movie User Rating )

Files:
		edX-MovieLens.Rmd             R code + Markdown
		edX-MovieLens.R               R code 
		edX-MovieLens.pdf             pdf output
		
		Supplementary files for H2o models
		
		edX-MovieLens-H2o.Rmd
		edX-MovieLens-H2o.R
		edX-MovieLens-H2o.pdf
		
Notes:
		All R code is tested on Windows OS only. Mac was excluded.
		A flag in the code, controls if models are to be generated for each code run or not. This is to save time, due to huge dataset and multiple algorithms involved. However, predictions are done on test data for each run of the code.

Pre-fitted Model files:

		Matrix_2.Rdata
		Matrix_1.Rdata
		Collab_1.Rdata
		Collab_2.Rdata
		
Dataset files:

		edx.Rdata
		Validation.Rdata
		
Approximate run-time of code
		Flag = OFF, 20 minutes
		Flag = ON, > 24 hours
